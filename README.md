# Python Intermediate Coding Challenges

## Introduction

Welcome to the Python Intermediate Coding Challenges! This series of tasks is designed to test and improve your Python programming skills across a range of crucial areas. By working through these challenges, you'll get hands-on experience with algorithmic problem solving, data manipulation, object-oriented programming (OOP), and even building a small-scale application integrated with a database and a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Objectives

These challenges aim to:

1. **Deepen Your Understanding**: By working on these tasks, you'll solidify your understanding of Python's core concepts, extending beyond just syntax into practical application.
2. **Broaden Your Skillset**: This series exposes you to a variety of Python's capabilities, from handling string manipulation challenges to managing data in databases and creating GUI applications.
3. **Simulate Real-world Scenarios**: These tasks are designed to mirror problems you might encounter in the real world, helping to prepare you for more complex projects or job-related tasks.
4. **Promote Best Practices**: The emphasis on testing, clean code, and proper design patterns ensures that you're not just writing code that works, but code that's efficient, scalable, and maintainable.

## Overview of Tasks

1. **Algorithmic Challenge**: Dive into the world of algorithms and data structures by crafting a function that identifies palindromes.
2. **Data Manipulation**: Flex your `pandas` muscles with an e-commerce dataset, where you'll gain insights from real-world data and make meaningful visualizations.
3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Understand the principles of OOP by modeling geometric shapes, encapsulating their properties and behaviors, and testing their functionalities.
4. **Application Building**: Take a holistic approach to programming by developing a family tree application. This task integrates various components: defining the data structure (using OOP), storing data (SQLite database), and creating a user-friendly interface (GUI).

## Conclusion

By the end of these challenges, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of Python's vast capabilities and be well-equipped to tackle even more complex problems. Best of luck, and happy coding!
