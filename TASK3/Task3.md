## Task 1: Palindrome Checker


<strong>Objective:</strong> <br>
Write a Python function that checks whether a given user-input string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

<strong>Instructions:</strong> <br>
The program should prompt the user to input a phrase or a sequence of characters.
The program should ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when checking for palindromes.
After processing, the program should display whether the entered phrase is a palindrome or not. <br>

<strong>Example:</strong>

<em>Input:</em>
    Please enter a phrase to check if it's a palindrome: A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!



<em>Output:</em>
The entered phrase is a palindrome!
